                    <p>Hello! My name is Kenneth Li and I am passionate about coding, software development, and
                        understanding
                        the various technologies that have become a pillar of support for modern society.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether it be writing papers and relaxing, computers and technology have always been a really big
                        picture
                        in my life. However, as I continued utilizing technology one question always stayed in the back
                        of my mind.
                        "How does this work, what make it tick?" This question eventually lead me to coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>To me coding is about the experience of creating and building. Collaboration with other
                        individuals who have
                        similar passions is also vital; they display the various creative views different people have
                        when they code.
                        It has taught me how to tackle problems from multiple angles and to always keep an open mind to
                        new ideas.
                        I will never forget my experiences with coding, I and plan to continue to sate my curiosity on
                        new technologies.

                    <p>Hello! My name is Quan Le, and I'm passionate about coding, engineering, and how technology has
                        made our lives easier.</p>
                    <p>I recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine in Mechanical Engineering. If I
                        learned anything from engineering
                        school, it's to work smarter, not harder. That's why I'm passionate about how technologies help
                        people be more connected,
                        productive, and efficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've had the privilege to study two disciplines I love: engineering and software development. I
                        was introduced to coding in my third
                        year of engineering school, and I've pursued it ever since. After two years working as a
                        mechanical engineer, I started coding and web
                        development. It wasn't until almost two years working as an engiener that I decided I was ready
                        to take the next big step.
                    </p>
                    <p>My goal is to integrate emerging AI and advancing technologies to increase productivity in
                        people's lives. When people are more productive
                        with their time, they hcan a cheive better work-life balance and pursue their passions.

                    <p>Hi, my name is Jason Yata and Iâ€™m extremely passionate about coding, software development, and how
                    AI can be used to help others in their personal and professional lives. Technology and computers
                    have always been a huge part of my life whether it was learning to type to writing my first function
                    in Javascript or building a fully functional live sports stats application.</p>

                    <p>Creating physical projects is a longtime hobby of mine and being able to utilize those same problem
                    solving skills when developing web applications has been an exciting transition. I am very
                    passionate about delivering a thoughtful, fluid user experience and have been fortunate enough to
                    explore that passion during my time at LearningFuze.</p>

                    <p>My future goal is to integrate my curiosity for AI and my love for assisting others by helping to
                    create different avenues of automation. I believe I would be a great asset to your team and am
                    extremely excited for the opportunity to hone my skills as a developer and contribute to your
                    company.</p>
